**Problem Statement**

Online shopping often leaves customers unsure about how products will look or fit in their real-world environments, leading to frequent returns and dissatisfaction. Current platforms provide limited solutions to this issue, relying on static images and descriptions that donâ€™t offer a true sense of size or appearance. This results in frustration for both customers and retailers due to mismatched expectations. This project aims to create a shopping app that uses AR technology by allowing customers to visualize products in their actual spaces before purchase, helping reduce returns and enhancing customer satisfaction.
